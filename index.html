            <h1>Project Initiation: Team BETA</h1>
            <h2>Autonomous Follow-Me Robot Strategy</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Team BETA, composed of <span class="highlight">Maier, Ayan, and Abdul Rehman</span>, is entering the primary planning phase for an Autonomous Follow-Me Robotic platform. This project is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical electronics and physical automation. Our initial research focuses on creating a reliable tracking system using ultrasonic wave propagation.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The objective of this phase is to define the hardware requirements and develop a logical roadmap for the system's architecture. By establishing clear engineering goals now, we ensure that our future build will be stable, responsive, and efficient. This presentation outlines our blueprint for the upcoming development cycle.

            <h1>The Central Logic Unit</h1>
            <h2>Selecting the Arduino Platform</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                For our central processor, the team has selected the <span class="highlight">Arduino</span> platform. Our planning dictates that we need a controller with sufficient I/O pins and a clock speed capable of processing sonar data without significant latency. The Arduino is ideal because it allows for rapid prototyping and has a robust library system for motor control.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                During the planning phase, Maier, Ayan, and Abdul Rehman are mapping out the specific digital and analog pins required to interface with the sensors and drivers. This documentation is critical to ensure that our future software code aligns perfectly with the physical hardware connections.

            <h1>Proposed Wiring Schematic</h1>
            <h2>Design and Signal Path Planning</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                A critical part of our current planning is the <span class="highlight">Technical Wiring Map</span>. We are designing a layout that prioritizes signal integrity. This involves planning the paths for the 5V logic lines and the 9V power lines. Team BETA is focused on a "Star Ground" configuration to minimize electrical noise that could interfere with our distance readings.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The schematic we are developing will serve as the master guide during the assembly phase. By documenting every jumper wire and resistor value now, Maier, Ayan, and Abdul Rehman are taking a professional "Design First" approach to robotics, significantly reducing the risk of short circuits or logic errors later.

            <h1>Spatial Perception Planning</h1>
            <h2>HC-SR04 Sensor Integration</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                To give the robot "vision," we have planned the integration of the <span class="highlight">HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor</span>. Our research indicates this is the most effective low-cost solution for indoor proximity detection. Our planning includes determining the optimal mounting height on the chassis to ensure a clear line of sight for the 40kHz acoustic pulses.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The sensor will be the primary source of input data for our autonomous logic. During this planning stage, we are calculating the necessary delay times between "pings" to avoid "ghost echoes"—a phenomenon where old sound waves interfere with new distance readings.

            <h2>Sonar Distance Modeling</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Our planning involves establishing the mathematical foundations of the robot. We are using the speed of sound—343 meters per second—as our constant. Team BETA is planning the implementation of the formula: <span class="highlight">Distance = (Time × 0.034) / 2</span>.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                By modeling these calculations before writing the code, Maier, Ayan, and Abdul Rehman can predict the robot's accuracy. We are also planning to implement a "Running Average" algorithm to smooth out sensor data, which will prevent the robot from reacting to small fluctuations in the ultrasonic readings.

                The team is currently designing the <span class="highlight">Decision Logic Flowchart</span>. This will be the "Mind" of the robot. We are planning a state-machine architecture that constantly evaluates the following conditions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proximity Brake:</strong> If the target is within a 15cm safety threshold, stop all motor activity.</li>
                <li><strong>Tracking Mode:</strong> If the target is between 20cm and 50cm, maintain forward velocity.</li>
                <li><strong>Search State:</strong> If the target is lost (Distance > 100cm), enter an idle scanning mode.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The <span class="highlight">L298N Motor Driver</span> is our planned interface for mechanical movement. Because the Arduino cannot drive motors directly, this module is a requirement. Our planning involves configuring the H-Bridge pins to allow for bi-directional control, which is essential for steering.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Maier, Ayan, and Abdul Rehman are studying the thermal properties of the L298N to ensure it does not overheat during extended use. We are also planning the jumper settings for the "Enable" pins to allow for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) speed control.

                We are planning to use two geared DC motors for the robot’s propulsion. Our focus is on <span class="highlight">Torque</span> over speed. Geared motors provide the necessary force to move the chassis while allowing for precise, low-speed maneuvers.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The team is also evaluating wheel diameters to determine the "RPM to Velocity" ratio. This planning is vital because it determines how fast the robot can catch up to a user who is walking at a normal pace.

                An essential step in our planning is the <span class="highlight">Pinout Table</span>. We are assigning specific digital pins for the Trigger and Echo functions of the HC-SR04, and PWM-capable pins for the motor driver speed control. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                This planning avoids "Pin Conflicts"—a common mistake where two components try to use the same internal timer of the Arduino. Maier, Ayan, and Abdul Rehman have documented these pins to ensure the future coding phase proceeds without hardware-related bugs.

                Team BETA is planning a 9V power delivery system. Our primary concern during this planning stage is <span class="highlight">Voltage Stability</span>. We are designing a power rail that separates the "noisy" motor current from the "clean" logic current.

            <p class="paragraph">Our planning includes a strict timeline. Week 1 is for circuit simulation. Week 2 is for chassis assembly. Week 3 is for core logic programming. By breaking the project into these planned segments, <span class="highlight">Maier, Ayan, and Abdul Rehman</span> can ensure that the project is submitted on time without rushing the critical testing phases.</p>

            <h2>Readiness for Construction</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">In conclusion, Team BETA has developed a comprehensive and professional plan for the Follow-Me Robot. We have defined our hardware, mapped our software logic, and analyzed the physics of our sensors. We are now ready to move from the planning phase into the physical construction phase with total confidence.</p>
