            <h2>Executive Project Overview</h2>
            <p class="content-text">Welcome to the technical summation of the <span class="highlight">Team BETA Follow-Me Robot</span>. This project represents a comprehensive exploration into the fields of autonomous navigation, sensor fusion, and real-time microcontroller processing. Our mission was to develop a mobile platform capable of object recognition and consistent proximity maintenance without human intervention.</p>
            <p class="content-text">Engineering Lead: <span class="highlight">Maier</span> | Hardware Lead: <span class="highlight">Ayan</span> | Systems Integration: <span class="highlight">Abdul Rehman</span>. Together, we have successfully integrated multiple hardware modules into a singular, responsive robotic entity.</p>

            <h2>Microcontroller Specifications</h2>
            <p class="content-text">At the center of our architecture is the <span class="highlight">Arduino</span> board. This device serves as the robot’s "Central Nervous System." It is an open-source electronics platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. Its primary role in our project is to act as the master controller that bridges the gap between digital logic and physical movement.</p>
            <p class="content-text">The Arduino executes a high-frequency polling loop. It sends a trigger pulse to the sensors, waits for a return signal, calculates the mathematical distance, and then outputs a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal to the motor driver to determine speed and direction. This allows for fluid and dynamic responses to environmental changes.</p>

            <h2>Circuit Topology and Signal Flow</h2>
            <p class="content-text">Successful robotic operation is dependent on precise <span class="highlight">Circuit Topology</span>. Our wiring map follows a complex schematic that ensures high-voltage power remains separated from low-voltage logic to prevent electrical interference. This diagram illustrates the interconnections between the 5V logic power and the 9V motor power rails.</p>
            <p class="content-text">The wiring layout utilizes a common ground (GND) across all modules to ensure a unified reference voltage. Any error in this map, such as a swapped Trig and Echo wire or an inverted motor polarity, would result in system failure. Maier, Ayan, and Abdul Rehman meticulously verified every bridge and jumper wire against this technical schematic to ensure total system reliability.</p>

            <h2>Sensory Perception Modules</h2>
            <p class="content-text">The "Eyes" of the Team BETA robot are powered by the <span class="highlight">HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor</span>. This module works on the principle of echolocation, similar to the biological sonar used by bats and dolphins. It consists of two primary transducers: a transmitter that sends out an ultrasonic pulse (40kHz) and a receiver that waits for that pulse to bounce off an object and return.</p>
            <p class="content-text">By measuring the exact time of travel for these sound waves, the Arduino can determine the location of the user with high accuracy. This allows the robot to "see" the distance between itself and the human subject, providing the necessary data for the follow-logic to execute.</p>

            <h1>📡 The Physics of Sonar Waves</h1>
            <h2>Time-of-Flight (ToF) Calculations</h2>
            <p class="content-text">To calculate the distance to an object, we use the speed of sound as a constant. Sound travels through the air at approximately <span class="highlight">343 meters per second</span>. The Arduino measures the "Duration" of the pulse in microseconds. We then apply a mathematical formula to convert this time into physical distance (centimeters).</p>
            <p class="content-text">Formula: <b>Distance = (Time × 0.034) / 2</b>. We must divide by two because the sound wave travels a round-trip: from the robot to the target and back again. Without this calculation, the robot would perceive the target as being twice as far away as it actually is.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Decision Matrix</h2>
            <p class="content-text">Our control system is based on a <span class="highlight">Decision Matrix</span> that dictates how the robot reacts to sensory input. Instead of pre-programmed paths, the robot makes real-time choices. This logic is categorized into three distinct "Zones of Engagement":</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Zone 1 (Safety Zone):</b> If the distance is less than 15cm, the robot initiates an immediate motor brake to prevent collision.</li>
                <li><b>Zone 2 (Tracking Zone):</b> If the distance is between 20cm and 50cm, the robot maintains a forward velocity to stay with the user.</li>
                <li><b>Zone 3 (Idle Zone):</b> If the distance is greater than 100cm, the robot stops and scans, assuming the target is lost.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="content-text">This conditional logic ensures the robot behaves in a way that feels natural and responsive to the user's movements.</p>

            <h1>⚡ L298N Dual H-Bridge Driver</h1>
            <h2>Power Regulation and Distribution</h2>
            <p class="content-text">Microcontrollers like the Arduino lack the current capacity to drive high-torque DC motors. Therefore, we integrated the <span class="highlight">L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver</span>. This module acts as an electrical gateway. It takes low-power commands from the Arduino pins and translates them into high-power currents from our 9V battery bank.</p>
            <p class="content-text">The H-Bridge circuit is essential because it allows the robot to change the direction of current flow to the motors. This gives us the ability to move forward, move backward, or turn by spinning wheels in opposite directions (differential steering).</p>

            <h2>Torque and Propulsion Engineering</h2>
            <p class="content-text"> propulsion is handled by two <span class="highlight">Geared DC Motors</span>. Unlike standard motors, geared motors use a gear reduction box to increase torque—the rotational force needed to push the robot’s weight—at the cost of some speed. This makes the robot much stronger and easier to control during slow movements.</p>
            <p class="content-text">Each motor is connected to a high-traction rubber wheel. By modulating the power to the left and right wheels separately, the robot can perform complex maneuvers, such as pivoting around a central axis to track a user who is turning a corner.</p>

            <h2>Input and Output (I/O) Management</h2>
            <p class="content-text">Managing the <span class="highlight">Pinout Configuration</span> is a vital step in hardware integration. Every sensor and actuator requires a specific dedicated pin on the Arduino. For this project, we designated specific digital pins for the Trigger and Echo functions of the sonar, and dedicated PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) pins for motor speed control.</p>
            <p class="content-text">PWM is a technique used to control the speed of the motors by switching the power on and off very quickly. This allows Maier and the team to make the robot move slowly when it is close to the user and speed up when the user starts to walk away.</p>

            <h2>Energy Storage and Distribution</h2>
            <p class="content-text">Robotics projects face a major challenge known as "Electrical Noise." When motors spin, they create small spikes in electricity that can interfere with the Arduino’s delicate circuitry. To solve this, Team BETA utilized a <span class="highlight">Dual-Power Strategy</span>. We used a 9V battery to power the motors through the L298N driver and a separate regulated supply for the Arduino logic.</p>
            <p class="content-text">Ensuring that the robot has enough "Current Capacity" is the difference between a robot that moves and a robot that just makes a humming sound. Our battery system provides the necessary Amps to keep the robot moving for the duration of the presentation.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Assembly Verification Phase</h2>
            <p class="content-text">Before we moved to the permanent chassis, Team BETA utilized a <span class="highlight">Breadboard</span>. This tool allows for solderless circuit testing. It was during this phase that Ayan and Abdul Rehman were able to swap wires and test different resistor values without damaging any expensive components. This stage is critical in the engineering lifecycle as it allows for rapid iteration of ideas.</p>

            <h2>Software Timing and Logic</h2>
            <p class="content-text">The Arduino does not measure distance in inches; it measures time in <span class="highlight">Microseconds</span>. One microsecond is one-millionth of a second. To achieve a smooth "follow" effect, our code must process these time values extremely quickly. Maier programmed the system to ignore "False Positives"—spikes in sound that aren't actually the target—ensuring the robot doesn't jitter or move randomly.</p>

            <h1>🏗️ Mechanical Chassis Design</h1>
            <h2>Structural Integrity and Balance</h2>
            <p class="content-text">The physical frame, or <span class="highlight">Chassis</span>, was engineered for balance. If the robot is too top-heavy, the sudden acceleration from the motors would cause it to flip over. We placed the heavy batteries at the lowest point of the frame to create a low center of gravity. This mechanical advantage allows the robot to start and stop abruptly while remaining perfectly stable.</p>

            <h2>Solving Real-World Technical Issues</h2>
            <p class="content-text">No project is perfect on the first try. Team BETA encountered "Phase Inversion" where the motors were spinning in opposite directions, causing the robot to spin in circles. Through systematic <span class="highlight">Debugging</span>, we traced the issue to a mirrored connection on the L298N board. Correcting this required a deep understanding of H-Bridge logic and motor polarity.</p>

            <h1>🎯 System Calibration</h1>
            <h2>Tuning for Peak Performance</h2>
            <p class="content-text">Calibration involves adjusting the software to match the physical world. We found that the robot was too sensitive to small movements, causing it to "stutter." By adding a <span class="highlight">Deadband</span>—a small range of distances where the robot does nothing—we were able to smooth out the movement, making it look professional and polished.</p>
